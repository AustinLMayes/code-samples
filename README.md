# Code Samples
This repository contains bits of code which I've written over the years. This is really just for my resume.

You can find other code I've written/contributed to on my Github profile.

**NOTE**: Most of this code is from a portion of private codebases, so it is likely to have unprovided dependencies and might not work at all.
