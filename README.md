# Code Samples
This repository contains bits of code which I've written over the years. This is really just for my resume. To the busy recruiter who has a long day ahead of them, you're welcome.

You can find other code I've written/contributed to on my Github profile. All code in this repository is from projects outside of my main account/private projects.

Each file, if it was from a public repository somewhere, will have a link back to the repository it came from. You can check out those links to get more context and to see the other awesome people I have collaborated with.

**NOTE**: Most of this code is from a portion of private codebases, so it is likely to have unprovided dependencies and might not work at all.
